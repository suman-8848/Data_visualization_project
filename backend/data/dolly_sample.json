    "context": "",
    "response": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy. Plants use chlorophyll in their leaves to absorb sunlight, which is then used to convert carbon dioxide from the air and water from the soil into glucose (sugar) and oxygen. The glucose provides energy for the plant's growth and development, while oxygen is released as a byproduct.",

    "context": "",
    "response": "DNA replication is the process by which a cell copies its DNA before cell division. The process begins when the double helix unwinds and the two strands separate. Each strand serves as a template for creating a new complementary strand. DNA polymerase enzymes add nucleotides to build the new strands, following base-pairing rules (A with T, G with C). The result is two identical DNA molecules, each containing one original strand and one newly synthesized strand.",
